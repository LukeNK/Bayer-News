Initially, Sanjowor citizens only expected 2 parties to run for the election, but a surprised candidate also joined the election. Luke and Peter are running for President and Vice President with the slogan "Analyze. Formalize. Modernize". They made 8 promises to transform the Democratic Republic of Sanjowor into a better server by codifying laws and fully abolishing the tax. 
The other pair of candidates include Dravo and Peter, who promised to make stricter laws against "illegal stuff", lowering tax, make a program to make citizens happy, and do opinion surveys. So far we haven't seen any campaign from Fushiiii Democracy Party (FDP).
