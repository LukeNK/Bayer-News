The schedule for the second parliamentary election was published by the Election Commission (EC). Officially starting on 24/4 and voting on 7/5, the election is to select five Members of Parliament (MP) for four-month terms. Currently, there are five candidates so it would result in everybody being the new MPs. 
The EC already made a new voting bot for this election with Id hashing feature to keep voters' identities safe and locally host on Luke's computer with a fullscreen stream for the entire voting day. At the end of the voting day, Luke and Jarrie will count the ballots (using the Instant-runoff voting system) in VC to ensure transparency.
